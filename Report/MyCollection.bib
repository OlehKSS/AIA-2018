abstract = {In this paper we propose a new approach for false positive reduction in the field of mammographic mass detection. The goal is to distinguish between the true recognized masses and the ones which actually are normal parenchyma. Our proposal is based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for representing salient micro-patterns and preserving at the same time the spatial structure of the masses. Once the descriptors are extracted, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for classifying the detected masses. We test our proposal using a set of 1792 suspicious regions of interest extracted from the DDSM database. Exhaustive experiments illustrate that LBP features are effective and efficient for false positive reduction even at different mass sizes, a critical aspect in mass detection systems. Moreover, we compare our proposal with current methods showing that LBP obtains better performance.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148â€“156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are standardized by age to the 2000 United States standard million population. A total of 1,479,350 new cancer cases and 562,340 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2009. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.8{\%} per year from 2001 to 2005) and women (0.6{\%} per year from 1998 to 2005), largely because of decreases in the three major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and in two major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Overall cancer death rates decreased in men by 19.2{\%} between 1990 and 2005, with decreases in lung (37{\%}), prostate (24{\%}), and colorectal (17{\%}) cancer rates accounting for nearly 80{\%} of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2005 decreased by 11.4{\%}, with decreases in breast (37{\%}) and colorectal (24{\%}) cancer rates accounting for 60{\%} of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates has resulted in the avoidance of about 650,000 deaths from cancer over the 15-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, education, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years of age. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

abstract = {Finding abnormalities in diagnostic images is a difficult task even for expert radiologists because the normal tissue locations largely outnumber those with suspicious signs which may thus be missed or incorrectly interpreted. For the same reason the design of a Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) system is very complex because the large predominance of normal samples in the training data may hamper the ability of the classifier to recognize the abnormalities on the images. In this paper we present a novel approach for computer-aided detection which faces the class imbalance with a cascade of boosting classifiers where each node is trained by a learning algorithm based on ranking instead of classification error. Such approach is used to design a system (CasCADe) for the automated detection of clustered microcalcifications ($\mu$Cs), which is a severely unbalanced classification problem because of the vast majority of image locations where no $\mu$C is present. The proposed approach was evaluated with a dataset of 1599 full-field digital mammograms from 560 cases and compared favorably with the Hologic R2CAD ImageChecker, one of the most widespread commercial CADe systems. In particular, at the same lesion sensitivity of R2CAD (90{\%}) on biopsy proven malignant cases, CasCADe and R2CAD detected 0.13 and 0.21 false positives per image (FPpi), respectively (p-value. = 0.09), whereas at the same FPpi of R2CAD (0.21), CasCADe and R2CAD detected 93{\%} and 90{\%} of true lesions respectively (p-value. = 0.11) thus showing that CasCADe can compete with high-end CADe commercial systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the world. Several computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems have been used to assist health experts and to indicate suspect areas that would be difficult to perceive by the human eye; this approach has aided in the detection and diagnosis of cancer. The present work proposes a method for the automatic detection of masses in digital mammograms by using quality threshold (QT), a correlogram function, and the support vector machine (SVM). This methodology comprises the following steps: The first step is to perform preprocessing with a low-pass filter, which increases the scale of the contrast, and the next step is to use an enhancement to the wavelet transform with a linear function. After the preprocessing is segmentation using QT; then, we perform post-processing, which involves the selection of the best mass candidates. This step is performed by analyzing the shape descriptors through the SVM. For the stage that involves the extraction of texture features, we used Haralick descriptors and a correlogram function. In the classification stage, the SVM was again used for training, validation, and final test. The results were as follows: sensitivity 92.31 {\%}, specificity 82.2 {\%}, accuracy 83.53 {\%}, mean rate of false positives per image 1.12, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.8033. Breast cancer is notable for presenting the highest mortality rate in addition to one of the smallest survival rates after diagnosis. An early diagnosis means a considerable increase in the survival chance of the patients. The methodology proposed herein contributes to the early diagnosis and survival rate and, thus, proves to be a useful tool for specialists who attempt to anticipate the detection of masses.},

Second, we apply the Hough transformation algorithm on the preprocessed image and locate the lesion as an approximate parametric circle which would be used as the initial contour of Snake model followed by. Finally, the mass boundary is accurately segmented based on coarse localization. This approach is tested on digital database for screening mammography and mammography image analysis society database and the performance is evaluated from three aspects: detection rate, area-based accuracy, and distance-based boundary similarity measures based on manual-segmented results. By comparison, we find that our improved method has higher detection rate and the segmented contours are much closer to the actual area of objects. The promising results indicate that our approach can provide some theoretical basis for computer-aided image detection system.},

abstract = {Mass Detection Feature Extraction Classification observed in detection mass are as follows: â€¢ Intensity levels vary greatly across different regions in a mammogram, and features for segmentation are hard to formulate. â€¢ Subtle grey level variations across different parts of the image make the segmentation of tumor areas by grey level alone difficult. â€¢ Tumors (masses) are not always obvious. â€¢ Poor illumination and high noise levels in the image that can vary up to 10-15{\%} of the maximum pixel entity III. METHODOLOGY-EXISTING METHODS TO DETECT MASS IN MAMMOGRAM IMAGES Most of the mass detection algorithm will be performed in four phases. First, image preprocessing of the digitized mammogram can suppress noise and improve the contrast of the image. Second, image segmentation is defined by most of the articles about mass detection as locating the suspicious regions. It is different from the common definition of segmentation in image processing. In the third phase, features are extracted and selected for classifying lesion types or removing false positives. Finally, the detection/ classification of masses will be conducted. In this review preprocessing of mammogram image, detection of ROI and segmentation, feature selection and extraction, classification and evaluation are studied [5] [6]. Fig. 2.

We conduct the experiment on both DDSM database and MIAS database, firstly extract the region of interests (ROIs) with chain codes and using the rough set (RS) method to enhance theROIs, secondly segment the mass region from the location ROIs with an improved vector field convolution (VFC) snake and following extract features from the mass region and its surroundings, and then establish features database with 32 dimensions; finally, these features are used as input to several classification techniques.

abstract = {PURPOSE To develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme for mass detection on digitized mammograms that achieves a high sensitivity while maintaining a low false positive (FP) rate using morphological enhancement and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method. METHODS The authors developed a multiple stage method for breast mass detection. The proposed CAD scheme consists of five major components: (1) preprocessing based on morphological enhancement, which enhances mass-like patterns while removing unrelated background clutters, (2) segmentation of mass candidates based on the SLIC method, which groups mass and background tissue into different regions, (3) prescreening of suspicious regions using rule-based classification that eliminates regions unlikely to represent masses, (4) potential lesion contour refinement based on distance regularized level set evolution, and (5) FP reduction based on feature extraction and an ensemble of undersampled support vector machines. Two datasets were built to design and evaluate the system: a mass dataset containing 187 cases (386 mammograms) and a nonmass dataset containing 88 mammograms. All cases were acquired from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Approximately two thirds of the available masses were used for training the system, and the remaining masses and nonmass dataset were used for testing. RESULTS Testing of the proposed CAD system on the mass dataset yielded a mass-based sensitivity of 98.55{\%}, 97.10{\%}, 92.75{\%} at 0.84, 0.63, 0.55 FP mark/image, respectively. Tested on the nonmass dataset, the scheme showed a FP rate of 0.55, 0.34, 0.30 mark/image. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that the system is promising in improving the performance of current CAD systems by reducing FP rate while achieving relatively high sensitivity.},

abstract = {: The distinctive properties of graphene, characterized by its high carrier mobility and biocompatibility, have stimulated extreme scientific interest as a promising nanomaterial for future nanoelectronic applications. In particular, graphene-based transistors have been developed rapidly and are considered as an option for DNA sensing applications. Recent findings in the field of DNA biosensors have led to a renewed interest in the identification of genetic risk factors associated with complex human diseases for diagnosis of cancers or hereditary diseases. In this paper, an analytical model of graphene-based solution gated field effect transistors (SGFET) is proposed to constitute an important step towards development of DNA biosensors with high sensitivity and selectivity. Inspired by this fact, a novel strategy for a DNA sensor model with capability of single-nucleotide polymorphism detection is proposed and extensively explained. First of all, graphene-based DNA sensor model is optimized using particle swarm optimization algorithm. Based on the sensing mechanism of DNA sensors, detective parameters (I(ds) and V(gmin)) are suggested to facilitate the decision making process. Finally, the behaviour of graphene-based SGFET is predicted in the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphism with an accuracy of more than 98{\%} which guarantees the reliability of the optimized model for any application of the graphene-based DNA sensor. It is expected to achieve the rapid, quick and economical detection of DNA hybridization which could speed up the realization of the next generation of the homecare sensor system. },

The proposed method uses particle swarm optimization over a polar coordinate system to increase the energy-minimizing capability with respect to the traditional active contour model. In the first stage, to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, a set of synthetic images containing objects with several concavities and Gaussian noise is presented. Subsequently, MACPSO is used to segment the human heart and the human left ventricle from datasets of sequential computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, respectively. Finally, to assess the performance of the medical image segmentations with respect to regions outlined by experts and by the graph cut method objectively and quantifiably, a set of distance and similarity metrics has been adopted. The experimental results demonstrate that MACPSO outperforms the traditional active contour model in terms of segmentation accuracy and stability. },

abstract = {The area of surface reconstruction has seen substantial progress in the past two decades. The traditional problem addressed by surface reconstruction is to recover the digital representation of a physical shape that has been scanned, where the scanned data contains a wide variety of defects. While much of the earlier work has been focused on reconstructing a piece-wise smooth representation of the original shape, recent work has taken on more specialized priors to address significantly challenging data imperfections, where the reconstruction can take on different representations â€“ not necessarily the explicit geometry. This state-of-the-art report surveys the field of surface reconstruction, providing a categorization with respect to priors, data imperfections, and reconstruction output. By considering a holistic view of surface reconstruction, this report provides a detailed characterization of the field, highlights similarities between diverse reconstruction techniques, and provides directions for future work in surface reconstruction.},

At each iteration of the ICP algorithm, the change of relative pose that gives the minimal point-to-plane error is usually solved using standard nonlinear least-squares methods, which are often very slow. Fortunately, when the relative orientation between the two input surfaces is small, we can approximate the nonlinear optimization problem with a linear least-squares one that can be solved more efficiently. We detail the derivation of a linear system whose least-squares solution is a good approximation to that obtained from a nonlinear optimization.},

In particular, it builds on earlier results from the FERET face recognition evaluation studies, which created a large face database (1,196 subjects) and a baseline face recognition system for comparative evaluations. This study looks at using a combinations of traditional distance measures (City-block, Euclidean, Angle, Mahalanobis) in Eigenspace to improve performance in the matching stage of face recognition. A statistically significant improvement is observed for the Mahalanobis distance alone when compared to the other three alone. However, no combinations of these measures appear to perform better than Mahalanobis alone. This study also examines questions of how many Eigenvectors to select and according to what ordering criterion. It compares variations in performance due to different distance measures and numbers of Eigenvectors. Ordering Eigenvectors according to a like-image difference value rather than their Eigenvalues is also considered.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

abstract = {Poisson surface reconstruction creates watertight surfaces from oriented point sets. In this work we extend the technique to explicitly incorporate the points as interpolation constraints. The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions.},

Compared to iso-surfaces, extremal surfaces are particularly challenging to construct in part due to the presence of boundaries and the lack of a consistent orientation. We present a novel, grid-based algorithm for constructing polygonal approximations of extremal surfaces that may be open or unorientable. The algorithm is simple to implement and applicable to both uniform and adaptive grid structures. More importantly, the resulting discrete surface preserves the structural property of the extremal surface in a grid-independent manner. The algorithm is applied to extract ridge surfaces from intensity volumes and reconstruct surfaces from point sets with unoriented normals. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Our models are neural networks trained on human clicks and importance annotations on hundreds of designs. We collected a new dataset of crowdsourced importance, and analyzed the predictions of our models with respect to ground truth importance and human eye movements. We demonstrate how such predictions of importance can be used for automatic design retargeting and thumbnailing. User studies with hundreds of MTurk participants validate that, with limited post-processing, our importance-driven applications are on par with, or outperform, current state-of-the-art methods, including natural image saliency.

abstract = {Video, like images, should support content aware resizing. We present video retargeting using an improved seam carving operator. Instead of removing 1D seams from 2D images we remove 2D seam manifolds from 3D space-time volumes. To achieve this we replace the dynamic programming method of seam carving with graph cuts that are suitable for 3D volumes. In the new formulation, a seam is given by a minimal cut in the graph and we show how to construct a graph such that the resulting cut is a valid seam. That is, the cut is monotonic and connected. In addition, we present a novel energy criterion that improves the visual quality of the retargeted images and videos. The original seam carving operator is focused on removing seams with the least amount of energy, ignoring energy that introduced into the images and videos by applying the operator. To counter this, the new criterion is looking forward in time - removing seams that introduce the least amount of energy into the retargeted result. We show how to encode the improved criterion into graph cuts (for images and videos) as well as dynamic programming (for images). We apply our technique to images and videos and present results of various applications.},

How- ever, no single retargeting operator performs well on all images and all target sizes. In a user study we conducted, we found that users prefer to combine seam carving with cropping and scaling to pro- duce results they are satisfied with. This inspires us to propose an algorithm that combines different operators in an optimal manner. We define a resizing space as a conceptual multi-dimensional space combining several resizing operators, and show how a path in this space defines a sequence of operations to retarget media. We de- fine a new image similarity measure, which we term Bi-Directional Warping (BDW), and use it with a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal path in the resizing space. In addition, we show a simple and intuitive user interface allowing users to explore the re- sizing space of various image sizes interactively. Using key-frames and interpolation we also extend our technique to retarget video, providing the flexibility to use the best combination of operators at different times in the sequence.},

abstract = {Content-aware image resizing is a kind of new and effective approach for image resizing, which preserves image content well and does not cause obvious distortion when changing the aspect ratio of images. Recently, a seam based approach for content-aware image resizing was proposed by Avidan and Shamir. Their results are impressive, but because the method uses dynamic programming many times, it is slow. In this paper, we present a more efficient algorithm for seam based content-aware image resizing, which searches seams through establishing the matching relation between adjacent rows or columns. We give a linear algorithm to find the optimal matches within a weighted bipartite graph composed of the pixels in adjacent rows or columns. Therefore, our method is fast (e.g. our method needs only about 100 ms to reduce a 768 1024 images width to 1/3 while Avidan and Shamirs method needs 12 s). This supports immediate image resizing whereas Avidan and Shamirs method requires a more costly pre-processing step to enable subsequent real-time processing. A fast method such as the one proposed will be also needed for future real-time video resizing applications.},

abstract = {In MRI, phase maps can provide useful information about parameters such as field  inhomogeneity, velocity of blood flow, and the chemical shift between water and fat. As phase is defined in the (-pi,pi] range, however, phase wraps often occur, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. This work presents a two-dimensional phase unwrapping algorithm that uses quality-guided region growing and local linear estimation. The quality map employs the variance of the second-order partial derivatives of the phase as the quality criterion. Phase information from unwrapped neighboring pixels is used to predict the correct phase of the current pixel using a linear regression method. The algorithm was tested on both simulated and real data, and is shown to successfully unwrap phase images that are corrupted by noise and have rapidly changing phase.},

In this method, the optimal order of matching the positive residues with the negative residues is first identified by the dPSO algorithm, then the branch cuts are placed to join each pair of the opposite polarity residues, and in the last step phases are unwrapped by flood-fill algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on both simulated phase image and MRI wrapped phase data sets. The results demonstrated that, compared with conventionally used branch-cut phase unwrapping algorithms, the dPSO algorithm is rather robust and effective.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare changes in the signal intensity (SI) ratio of the dentate nucleus (DN) to the pons, DN to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and globus pallidus (GP) to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans after serial injections of the macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent gadobutrol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who had received at least 5 MRI examinations (plus an additional last MRI for reference) with the exclusive use of gadobutrol, resulting in a total cumulative dose of 54.1 +/- 30.4 mL gadobutrol, were analyzed retrospectively. Signal intensity ratio differences were calculated for DN-to-pons, DN-to-CSF, and GP-to-thalamus ratios by subtracting the SI ratio at the first MRI from the SI ratio at the last MRI scan. One-sample t tests were employed to examine if they differed from 0. Regression and correlational analyses were performed to examine whether the SI ratio differences were predicted by a number of control variables. RESULTS: Signal intensity ratio differences did not differ significantly from 0, neither for the DN-to-pons ratio (-0.0035 +/- 0.0476, P = 0.69), the DN-to-CSF ratio (-0.0539 +/- 0.3217, P = 0.37), nor the GP-to-thalamus ratio (-0.0020 +/- 0.0211, P = 0.60). None of the control variables predicted changes in SI ratios. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a recently published study, we did not find signal increases in the DN or in the GP after serial injections of gadobutrol, even though the total dose applied here was considerably larger than in the respective study. This finding adds further support to the hypothesis that the molecular structure of a gadolinium-based contrast agent as either macrocyclic or linear is a crucial factor for its potential to cause gadolinium deposition in the brain. Future studies should further assess this hypothesis by additional animal investigations as well as histopathological and clinical correlation studies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate if application of macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents in volunteers is associated with neuronal deposition detected by magnetic resonance imaging in a 5-year longitudinal survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighty-seven volunteers who participated in a population-based study were enrolled. Subjects underwent plain T1-weighted brain MRI at baseline and 5 years later with identical sequence parameters. At baseline, 271 participants additionally received intravenous injection of the macrocyclic contrast agent gadobutrol (1.5 mmol/kg). A control group including 116 subjects received no contrast agent. Relative signal intensities of thalamus, pallidum, pons and dentate nucleus were compared at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: No difference in relative signal intensities was observed between contrast group (thalamus, p = 0.865; pallidum, p = 0.263; pons, p = 0.533; dentate nucleus, p = 0.396) and control group (thalamus, p = 0.683; pallidum; p = 0.970; pons, p = 0.773; dentate nucleus, p = 0.232) at both times. Comparison between both groups revealed no significant differences in relative signal intensities (thalamus, p = 0.413; pallidum, p = 0.653; pons, p = 0.460; dentate nucleus, p = 0.751). The study showed no significant change in globus pallidus-to-thalamus or dentate nucleus-to-pons ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Five years after administration of a 1.5-fold dose gadobutrol to normal subjects, signal intensity of thalamus, pallidum, pons and dentate nucleus did not differ from participants who had not received gadobutrol. KEY POINTS: * Gadobutrol does not lead to neuronal signal alterations after 5 years. * Neuronal deposition of macrocyclic contrast agent could not be confirmed. * Macrocyclic contrast agents in a proven dosage are safe.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate signal changes in the dentate nucleus on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images after multiple administrations of gadopentetate dimeglumine versus gadobutrol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two study groups were identified, each of which included 25 consecutive patients. Each group received six or more administrations of either gadobutrol only or gadopentetate dimeglumine only, without having had exposure to any other gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). The mean signal intensity (SI) in the dentate nucleus on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images was measured, with the use of the pons and the cerebellar peduncle as references to calculate the DNP SI ratio (i.e., the ratio of the SI in the dentate nucleus to the SI in the pons) and the DCP SI ratio (i.e., the ratio of the SI in the dentate nucleus to the SI in the cerebellar peduncle). RESULTS: After six administrations of gadopentetate dimeglumine, the SI in the dentate nucleus on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images increased from a DCP SI ratio of 0.997 before administration to 1.034 after the last of six administrations (p = 0.0007) and then to 1.063 after all administrations (p = 0.0004). No statistically significant increase was noted in association with administration of gadobutrol, for which the DCP SI ratio was 0.995 before administration, 1.009 after the last of six administrations (p = 0.1172), and 0.992 after all administrations (p = 0.7592). The change in the DCP SI ratio after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine correlated with the number of administrations the patient received (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Unenhanced T1 signal hyperintensity was observed in the dentate nucleus after multiple administrations of gadopentetate dimeglumine, a linear ionic agent, but not after multiple administrations of gadobutrol, a macrocyclic GBCA.},

The patient presented here had no history of intracranial pathology which would alter the blood brain barrier or abnormal renal function. The clinical significance of gadolinium accumulation in the human body is currently unknown but is of concern, particularly in pediatric patients who have a lifetime to manifest any potential adverse consequences. Therefore, research is needed to address the clinical significance, if any, of gadolinium deposition in the developing pediatric brain. Given these current uncertainties, clinicians should continue to use prudence in selecting pediatric patients to undergo contrasted MRI and in selecting the appropriate contrast agents to use.},

abstract = {Gadolinium-based contrast agents (primarily those with linear chelates) are associated with a dose-dependent signal hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus and the globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted MRI following administration to selected patients with normal renal function. The accumulation of gadolinium has also been reported in the skin, heart, liver, lung, and kidney of patients with impaired renal function suffering from nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Here we report on three patients with impaired renal function and vascular calcification (two with confirmed NSF) whose unenhanced T1-weighted MRIs showed conspicuous high signal intensity in the dentate nucleus and the globus pallidus after they had been exposed to relatively low doses of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (0.27, 0.45, and 0.68 mmol/kg). Signal ratios between dentate nucleus and pons and between globus pallidus and thalamus were comparable with previously reported measurements in subjects without renal impairment. Of note, all three analysed patients suffered from transient signs of neurological disorders of undetermined cause. In conclusion, the exposure to 0.27-0.68 mmol/kg of linear gadolinium-based contrast agent was associated with probable gadolinium accumulation in the brain of three patients suffering from impaired renal function and vascular calcification. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the frequency of hyperintensity in the dentate nucleus on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and to establish correlations between such hyperintensity and clinical factors, including a history of brain irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and each patient provided written informed consent. Three hundred sixty-two patients (164 men, 198 women; mean age, 62 years) were evaluated. Unenhanced T1-weighted MR images were obtained by using a spin-echo sequence at 3.0 T. Two neuroradiologists, who were blinded to clinical data, independently evaluated the signal intensity of the dentate nucleus compared with the signal intensity of the central white matter of the cerebellum by using a four-point graded response scale (grade 4 indicated prominent hyperintensity; grade 3, faint hyperintensity; grade 2, isointensity; and grade 1, hypointensity). Backward stepwise regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between signal intensity grades and the following clinical factors: sex, age, the interaction between age and sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, brain infarction, brain tumor, spinocerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis, a history of chemotherapy, and a history of brain irradiation. RESULTS: T1-hyperintense dentate nuclei were present in 41 (11{\%}) of the 362 patients. Of these 41 patients, 31 (76{\%}) had a history of brain irradiation. Signal intensity grade of the dentate nucleus on T1-weighted MR images correlated significantly with a history of brain irradiation (P {\textless} .001) but no other clinical factor. CONCLUSION: A hyperintense dentate nucleus may be seen on unenhanced T1-weighted MR images in some patients and may be associated with a history of brain irradiation.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 38 patients with MS and 37 patients with BM who had undergone at least 2 consecutive enhanced MRI examinations in our institution were examined for this retrospective observational study. The average T1 signal intensity of the dentate nuclei and the pons was obtained, and the dentate nuclei-to-pons (DNP) signal intensity ratio was calculated. These values were compared between patients with less than 6 and 6 enhanced MRI scans or more (eMRI). Relative changes of the DNP were plotted against the number of enhanced MRI scans (eMRIn). RESULTS: A progressive increase in the T1 signal intensity of the DNP ratio was observed both in the MS group and in the BM group. The DNP ratios of the last eMRI scans in the subgroup of patients with 6 eMRI scans or more were significantly higher than those of the first eMRI scan in the MS group (P {\textless} 0.001) and in the BM group (P {\textless} 0.01). Relative changes of the DNP showed a positive correlation with the eMRIn with a Spearman rho of 0.96 (P {\textless} 0.001) in the MS group and that of 0.88 (P {\textless} 0.001) in the BM group. Curve regression analyses of the relative change of DNP ratios showed linear models to best fit the data with r(2) of 0.89 in the MS group and r(2) of 0.74 in the BM group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the increase in the unenhanced T1 signal intensity has a linear relationship with the eMRIn in patients with MS and BM. Indeed, we estimated a linear regression model to fit the progressive increase in T1 signal intensity of the dentate nucleus after multiple enhanced MRI scans. This finding suggests substantial dechelation of gadodiamide in patients with normal renal function, raising further concerns regarding the stability of this agent. Further comparative studies with other gadolinium chelates, specifically both linear and macrocyclic, are strongly recommended.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Texture analysis (TA) has proved to be useful to distinguish different tissues and disease states using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TA has been successfully applied clinically to improve identification of abnormalities in the brain, liver, and bone and, more recently, has been used to enhance the specificity of breast MRI. This preclinical study used a custom-made phantom containing different grades of reticulated foam embedded in agarose gel to assess the capability of TA to distinguish between different texture objects, under different imaging conditions. The aim was to assess whether TA could be used reliably with clinical protocols that were not optimized for texture analysis and also to investigate the effect that changing imaging sequence parameters would have on the outcome of TA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Clinical fast gradient echo sequences and two different breast RF coils were used in order to reflect standard clinical practice. Three protocols were used: (1) a high spatial resolution protocol run on a 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner, (2) a parameter matched sequence run on a 3.0 T magnet, and (3) a high temporal resolution protocol also run on a 3.0 T magnet.For each protocol, three sequence parameters (repetition time, bandwidth/echo time, and flip angle) were altered from the baseline values to assess the impact of changes in acquisition parameters on the outcome of TA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: TA was performed using MAZDA software and clearly differentiated four foam phantoms when using the wavelet transform method (WAV), also moderately so with the co-occurrence matrix method (COM). The outcome was generally improved for imaging protocols acquired on the 3.0 T scanner, particularly for the high spatial resolution protocol where changes to the acquisition parameters influenced the TA, especially changes to the bandwidth/echo time. For the other protocols, TA outcome was less affected by changes to the imaging parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This phantom study shows that acquisition parameters and protocols that are typically used for clinical breast imaging can result in good TA. Our findings suggest that changes to sequence parameters may not greatly influence the outcome of texture analysis, but rather that spatial resolution may be the most important factor to consider.},

abstract = {We propose a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based classifier to address the task of small enhanced pathology segmentation. Specifically, we develop a Temporal Hierarchical Adaptive Texture CRF (THAT-CRF) and apply it to the challenging problem of gad enhancing lesion segmentation in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this context, the presence of many nonlesion enhancements (such as blood vessels) renders the problem more difficult. In addition to voxel-wise features, the framework exploits multiple higher order textures to discriminate the true lesional enhancements from the pool of other enhancements. Moreover, we are the first to incorporate temporal texture analysis in order to study the textures of enhanced candidates over time. Since lesional enhancements show more variation over time as compared to the non-lesional ones, temporal texture comparison increases the discrimination power of our method. The parameters of the THAT-CRF model are learned based on 2380 scans from a multi-center clinical trial. The effect of different components of the model is extensively evaluated on 120 scans from a separate multi-center clinical trial. It is shown that the incorporation of the temporal textures results in a general decrease of the false discovery rate. Specifically, THAT-CRF achieves overall sensitivity of 95{\%} along with false discovery rate of 20{\%} and average false positive count of 0.5 lesions per scan. The sensitivity of the temporal method to the trained time interval is further investigated on 5 different intervals of 69 patients. Moreover, superior performance is achieved by the reviewed labelings of our model (corrected only for the false detections) compared to the fully manual labeling when applied to the context of separating different treatment arms in a real clinical trial.},

abstract = {A multidimensional image navigation and display software was designed for display and interpretation of large sets of multidimensional and multimodality images such as combined PET-CT studies. The software is developed in Objective-C on a Macintosh platform under the MacOS X operating system using the GNUstep development environment. It also benefits from the extremely fast and optimized 3D graphic capabilities of the OpenGL graphic standard widely used for computer games optimized for taking advantage of any hardware graphic accelerator boards available. In the design of the software special attention was given to adapt the user interface to the specific and complex tasks of navigating through large sets of image data. An interactive jog-wheel device widely used in the video and movie industry was implemented to allow users to navigate in the different dimensions of an image set much faster than with a traditional mouse or on-screen cursors and sliders. The program can easily be adapted for very specific tasks that require a limited number of functions, by adding and removing tools from the program's toolbar and avoiding an overwhelming number of unnecessary tools and functions. The processing and image rendering tools of the software are based on the open-source libraries ITK and VTK. This ensures that all new developments in image processing that could emerge from other academic institutions using these libraries can be directly ported to the OsiriX program.

abstract = {The effect of pixel resolution on texture features computed using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was analyzed in the task of discriminating mammographic breast lesions as benign masses or malignant tumors. Regions in mammograms related to 111 breast masses, including 65 benign masses and 46 malignant tumors, were analyzed at pixel sizes of 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000Â $\mu$m. Classification experiments using each texture feature individually provided accuracy, in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), of up to 0.72. Using the Bayesian classifier and the leave-one-out method, the AUC obtained was in the range 0.73 to 0.75 for the pixel resolutions of 200 to 800Â $\mu$m, with 14 GLCM-based texture features using adaptive ribbons of pixels around the boundaries of the masses. Texture features computed using the ribbons resulted in higher classification accuracy than the same features computed using the corresponding regions within the mass boundaries. The t test was applied to AUC values obtained using 100 repetitions of random splitting of the texture features from the ribbons of masses into the training and testing sets. The texture features computed with the pixel size of 200Â $\mu$m provided the highest average AUC with statistically highly significant differences as compared to all of the other pixel sizes tested, except 100Â $\mu$m.},

abstract = {Learning the basic concepts required to understand magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a straightforward process. Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences. ? RSNA, 2005},

For the TA, features of the first and second order were used, and several classification procedures were applied for the classification of patients and controls. The choice of features was performed manually and by use of the Fischer coefficient, average correlation coefficients between features and multidimensional discrimination measure. RESULTS: All the statistical methods employed were able to differentiate between controls and patients in each group. The classification error varied around 8{\%}. CONCLUSION: We have shown that texture analysis can be successfully used for separating cirrhotic patients and healthy volunteers.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if repeated intravenous exposures to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are associated with neuronal tissue deposition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, signal intensities from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and postmortem neuronal tissue samples from 13 patients who underwent at least four GBCA-enhanced brain MR examinations between 2000 and 2014 (contrast group) were compared with those from 10 patients who did not receive GBCA (control group). Antemortem consent was obtained from all study participants. Neuronal tissues from the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus of these 23 deceased patients were harvested and analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy to quantify, localize, and assess the effects of gadolinium deposition. Associations between cumulative gadolinium dose, changes in T1-weighted MR signal intensity, and ICP-MS-derived tissue gadolinium concentrations were examined by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho). RESULTS: Compared with neuronal tissues of control patients, all of which demonstrated undetectable levels of gadolinium, neuronal tissues of patients from the contrast group contained 0.1-58.8 mug gadolinium per gram of tissue, in a significant dose-dependent relationship that correlated with signal intensity changes on precontrast T1-weighted MR images (rho = 0.49-0.93). All patients in the contrast group had relatively normal renal function at the time of MR examination. Gadolinium deposition in the capillary endothelium and neural interstitium was observed only in the contrast group. CONCLUSION: Intravenous GBCA exposure is associated with neuronal tissue deposition in the setting of relatively normal renal function. Additional studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of these findings and the generalizability to other GBCAs. Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether gadolinium (Gd) is deposited in brain and bone tissues in patients receiving only non-Group 1 agents, either macrocyclic or linear protein interacting Gd-based contrast agents, with normal renal function. Group 1 agents are linear agents most associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis that the US Federal Drug Administration has defined as contraindicated in patients at risk for this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was institutional review board approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant for retrospective review of records and also had signed autopsy consent authorizing use of decedent's tissue in research studies. Tissue samples were collected from 9 decedents undergoing autopsy who had contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with only single agent exposure to a non-Group 1 Gd-based contrast agent. Decedents with only noncontrast MRI or no MRI served as controls. Multiple brain areas, including globus pallidus and dentate nucleus, as well as bone and skin, were sampled and analyzed for Gd using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Gadolinium levels were compared between groups of decedents using the Mann-Whitney test and between brain and bone tissues of the same cases using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Of the 9 decedents, 5 received gadoteridol (ProHance; Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ), 2 received gadobutrol (Gadovist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ), and 1 each had gadobenate (MultiHance; Bracco Diagnostics) and gadoxetate (Eovist; Bayer Healthcare). Gadolinium was found with all agents in all brain areas sampled with highest levels in globus pallidus and dentate. Bone levels measured 23 times higher (median) than brain levels (P = 0.008 for bone vs globus pallidus) and showed a significant correlation (r = 0.81, P = 0.022). In controls, Gd levels in the brain were at or below limits of measurement and were significantly lower compared with study cases (P = 0.005 for globus pallidus). CONCLUSION: Gadolinium deposition in normal brain and bone tissue occurs with macrocyclic and linear protein interacting agents in patients with normal renal function. Deposition of Gd in cortical bone occurs at much higher levels compared with brain tissue and shows a notable correlation between the two. Thus, the bone may serve as a surrogate to estimate brain deposition if brain Gd were to become a useful clinical or research marker.},

Materials and Methods The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (reference no. S-324/2014). Owing to the retrospective character of the study, the ethical committee did not require any written informed consent. Two groups of 50 patients who underwent at least six consecutive MR imaging examinations with the exclusive use of either a linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or a macrocyclic GBCA (gadoterate meglumine) were analyzed retrospectively. The difference in mean SI ratios of DN to pons and GP to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted images from the last and first examinations was calculated. One-sample and independent-sample t tests were used to assess the difference in SI ratios for both groups, and regression analysis was performed to account for potential confounders. Results The SI ratio difference in the linear group was greater than 0 (mean DN difference Â± standard deviation, 0.0407 Â± 0.0398 [P {\textless} .001]; GP, 0.0287 Â± 0.0275 [P {\textless} .001]) and significantly larger (DN, P {\textless} .001 and standardized difference of 1.16; GP, P {\textless} .001 and standardized difference of 0.81) than that in the macrocyclic group, which did not differ from 0 (DN, 0.0016 Â± 0.0266 [P = .680]; GP, 0.0031 Â± 0.0354 [P = .538]). The SI ratio difference between the last and first examinations for the DN remained significantly different between the two groups in the regression analysis (P {\textless} .001). Conclusion This study indicates that an SI increase in the DN and GP on T1-weighted images is caused by serial application of the linear GBCA gadopentetate dimeglumine but not by the macrocyclic GBCA gadoterate meglumine. Clinical implications of this observation remain unclear. ? RSNA, 2015},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. Written informed consent for postmortem investigation was obtained either from the subject prior to his or her death or afterward from the subject's relatives. Brain tissues obtained at autopsy in five subjects who received a linear GBCA (GBCA group) and five subjects with no history of GBCA administration (non-GBCA group) were examined with ICP-MS. Formalin-fixed DN tissue, the inner segment of the GP, cerebellar white matter, the frontal lobe cortex, and frontal lobe white matter were obtained, and their gadolinium concentrations were measured. None of the subjects had received a diagnosis of severely compromised renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or acute renal failure. Fisher permutation test was used to compare gadolinium concentrations between the two groups and among brain regions. RESULTS: Gadolinium was detected in all specimens in the GBCA agent group (mean, 0.25 microg per gram of brain tissue +/- 0.44 [standard deviation]), with significantly higher concentrations in each region (P = .004 vs the non-GBCA group for all regions). In the GBCA group, the DN and GP showed significantly higher gadolinium concentrations (mean, 0.44 microg/g +/- 0.63) than other regions (0.12 microg/g +/- 0.16) (P = .029).

abstract = {In this study, a pattern recognition system has been developed for the discrimination of multiple sclerosis (MS) from cerebral microangiopathy (CM) lesions based on computer-assisted texture analysis of magnetic resonance images. Twenty-three textural features were calculated from MS and CM regions of interest, delineated by experienced radiologists on fluid attenuated inversion recovery images and obtained from 11 patients diagnosed with clinically definite MS and from 18 patients diagnosed with clinically definite CM. The probabilistic neural network classifier was used to construct the proposed pattern recognition system and the generalization of the system to unseen data was evaluated using an external cross validation process. According to the findings of the present study, statistically significant differences exist in the values of the textural features between CM and MS: MS regions were darker, of higher contrast, less homogeneous and rougher as compared to CM.},

abstract = {PurposeTo explore any correlation between the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations and high signal intensity (SI) in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.Materials and MethodsThe institutional review board approved this study, waiving the requirement to obtain written informed consent. A group of 381 consecutive patients who had undergone brain MR imaging was identified for cross-sectional analysis. For longitudinal analysis, 19 patients who had undergone at least six contrast-enhanced examinations were compared with 16 patients who had undergone at least six unenhanced examinations. The mean SIs of the dentate nucleus, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus were measured on unenhanced T1-weighted images. The dentate nucleus?to-pons SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the dentate nucleus by that in the pons, and the globus pallidus?to-thalamus SI ratio was calculated by dividing the SI in the globus pallidus by that in the thalamus. Stepwise regression analysis was undertaken in the consecutive patient group to detect any relationship between the dentate nucleus?to-pons or globus pallidus?to-thalamus SI ratio and previous gadolinium-based contrast material administration or other factors. A random coefficient model was used to evaluate for longitudinal analysis.ResultsThe dentate nucleus?to-pons SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P {\textless} .001; regression coefficient, 0.010; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.009, 0.011; standardized regression coefficient, 0.695). The globus pallidus?to-thalamus SI ratio showed a significant correlation with the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations (P {\textless} .001; regression coefficient, 0.004; 95{\%} CI: 0.002, 0.006; standardized regression coefficient, 0.288), radiation therapy (P = .009; regression coefficient,?0.014; 95{\%} CI: ?0.025, ?0.004; standardized regression coefficient, ?0.151), and liver function (P = .031; regression coefficient, 0.023; 95{\%} CI: 0.002, 0.044; standardized regression coefficient, 0.107). The dentate nucleus?to-pons and globus pallidus?to-thalamus SI ratios in patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced examinations were significantly greater than those of patients who had undergone unenhanced examinations (P {\textless} .001 for both).ConclusionHigh SI in the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus on unenhanced T1-weighted images may be a consequence of the number of previous gadolinium-based contrast material administrations.?

Samuel Walker examines the evolution, over more than a hundred years, of radiation protection standards and efforts to ensure radiation safety for nuclear workers and for the general public. The risks of radiationâ€”caused by fallout from nuclear bomb testing, exposure from medical or manufacturing procedures, effluents from nuclear power, or radioactivity from other sourcesâ€”have aroused more sustained controversy and public fear than any other comparable industrial or environmental hazard. Walker clarifies the entire radiation debate, showing that permissible dose levels are a key to the principles and practices that have prevailed in the field of radiation protection since the 1930s, and to their highly charged political and scientific history as well.},

abstract = {Gadolinium is highly toxic. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) consist of gadolinium ions and a chelating agent that binds the gadolinium ion tightly in order not to manifest its toxicity. Knowledge regarding gadolinium deposition in patients with normal renal function has advanced dramatically. Since 2014, increasing attention has been given to residual gadolinium known to accumulate in the tissues of patients with normal renal function. High signal intensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI) in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, and pulvinar region of the thalamus correlate roughly with the number of previous GBCA administrations. Pathological analyses have revealed that residual gadolinium is deposited not only in these brain regions, but also in extracranial tissues such as liver, skin and bone. The risks attendant with these deposits are unknown. Common sense dictates that gadolinium deposition be kept as low as possible, and that gadolinium contrast agents be used only when absolutely necessary, with preferential use of macrocyclic chelates, which seem to be deposited at lower concentrations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To evaluate changes in T1 and T2* relaxometry of dentate nuclei (DN) with respect to the number of previous administrations of Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). METHODS In 74 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) patients with variable disease duration (9.8Â±6.8 years) and severity (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores:3.1Â±0.9), the DN R1 (1/T1) and R2* (1/T2*) relaxation rates were measured using two unenhanced 3D Dual-Echo spoiled Gradient-Echo sequences with different flip angles. Correlations of the number of previous GBCA administrations with DN R1 and R2* relaxation rates were tested, including gender and age effect, in a multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS The DN R1 (normalized by brainstem) significantly correlated with the number of GBCA administrations (p{\textless}0.001), maintaining the same significance even when including MS-related factors. Instead, the DN R2* values correlated only with age (p=0.003), and not with GBCA administrations (p=0.67). In a subgroup of 35 patients for whom the administered GBCA subtype was known, the effect of GBCA on DN R1 appeared mainly related to linear GBCA. CONCLUSIONS In RR-MS patients, the number of previous GBCA administrations correlates with R1 relaxation rates of DN, while R2* values remain unaffected, suggesting that T1-shortening in these patients is related to the amount of Gadolinium given. KEY POINTS â€¢ In multiple sclerosis, previous Gadolinium administrations correlate with dentate nuclei T1 relaxometry. â€¢ Such correlation is linked to linear Gadolinium chelates and unrelated to disease duration or severity. â€¢ Dentate nuclei T2* relaxometry is age-related and independent of previous Gadolinium administrations. â€¢ Changes in dentate nuclei T1 relaxometry are not determined by iron accumulation. â€¢ MR relaxometry can quantitatively assess Gadolinium accumulation in dentate nuclei.},

The safety of these agents has been once again questioned after gadolinium deposits were observed and measured in brain and bone of patients with normal renal function. This retention of gadolinium in the human body has been termed ???gadolinium storage condition???. The long-term and cumulative effects of retained gadolinium in the brain and elsewhere are not as yet understood. Recently, patients who report that they suffer from chronic symptoms secondary to gadolinium exposure and retention created gadolinium-toxicity on-line support groups. Their self-reported symptoms have recently been published. Bone and joint complaints, and skin changes were two of the most common complaints. This condition has been termed ???gadolinium deposition disease???. In this review we will address gadolinium toxicity disorders, from acute adverse reactions to GBCAs to gadolinium deposition disease, with special emphasis on the latter, as it is the most recently described and least known.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for quantitative description of blood-vessel trees, which can be used for tree classification and/or physical parameters indirect monitoring. The method is based on texture analysis of 3D images of the trees. Several types of trees were defined, with distinct tree parameters (number of terminal branches, blood viscosity, input and output flow). A number of trees were computer-simulated for each type. 3D image was computed for each tree and its texture features were calculated. Best discriminating features were found and applied to 1-NN nearest neighbor classifier. It was demonstrated that (i) tree images can be correctly classified for realistic signal-to-noise ratio, (ii) some texture features are monotonously related to tree parameters, (iii) 2D texture analysis is not sufficient to represent the trees in the discussed sense. Moreover, applicability of texture model to quantitative description of vascularity images was also supported by unsupervised exploratory analysis. Eventually, the experimental confirmation was done, with the use of confocal microscopy images of rat brain vasculature. Several classes of brain tissue were clearly distinguished based on 3D texture numerical parameters, including control and different kinds of tumours - treated with NG2 proteoglycan to promote angiogenesis-dependent growth of the abnormal tissue. The method, applied to magnetic resonance imaging e.g. real neovasculature or retinal images can be used to support noninvasive medical diagnosis of vascular system diseases. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},
