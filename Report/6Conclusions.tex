\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:print}
In this project, a system was proposed for automated mass detection in mammogram images, with the potential to provide crucial assistance to radiologists. In our method, we realized preprocessing of full images, segmentation of the ROIs, and successive classification based on predefined features. The source code of our method implementation was can be found on \texttt{GitHub} \cite{IMMAS2018}. In the future, improvement of this module could be made using a larger dataset with more positive cases, as well as an additional, more precise segmentation technique, perhaps using the VFC Snake model.
Moreover, in real radiology practice, physicians do not analyze images as unrelated entities, but a full diagnostic comprises the comparison between different mammogram views and previous studies. Implementing this kind of reasoning in CAD systems could represent a major improvement in their performance. The development of CAD systems that can facilitate and assist in real time mammogram analysis is challenging but has the potential to make a vast impact on radiology practice.\par
