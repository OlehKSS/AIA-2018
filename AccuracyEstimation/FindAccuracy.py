"""
Write a function which finds the accuracy of a given output image given the image and the ground truth
Based on Alessandro Bria's C++ file compute-segmentation-accuracy.cpp

Accuracy (ACC) is defined as:
    ACC = (True positives + True negatives)/(number of samples)
    i.e., as the ratio between the number of correctly classified samples (in our case, pixels)
    and the total number of samples (pixels)
